### Project Overview

The focus of this project is to understand the investment behaviors and preferences of participants through data analysis. By examining the dataset, the main aim is to reveal insights into gender distribution, key numerical metrics, popular investment avenues, the reasons behind investment choices, savings goals, sources of investment information, investment durations, and the expectations participants have from their investments.

### Dataset:
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Data_set2-Copy.csv" file, contains individuals investment preferences and behaviors.

## Task 1
### Data Overview
### Objective: To understand the dataset structure
In Task 1, I loaded the dataset into a data analysis tool Tableau and used descriptive statistics to gather information on the dataset's structure, including the number of entries, columns, and data types. This helped establish a foundational understanding of the dataset's characteristics and organization.
